## Python Bootcamp 2019

This GitHub repository contains the materials for a 5-day, 2-hr/day Python
short course. This course is designed for incoming UC Berkeley Statistics
Masters students.

Since the class has a wide range of Python backgrounds, I've structured the
short course as a series of self-paced labs. The goal is to finish one lab a
day. To challenge even the students with Python background, there are ten labs
ranging in difficulty from beginner to advanced.

At the end of each day, students will fill out this Google Form to report their
daily learning progress: http://bit.ly/py-report . This will help me keep track
of learning goals and better serve the class.
